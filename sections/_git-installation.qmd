### macOS and Linux

Git is pre-installed on macOS and Linux computers, but users may want to update to the latest version.

On Macs, installation of Git is easiest using a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you do not have Homebrew installed, follow the instructions on the [Homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/). Then install Git with:

``` bash
brew install git
```

Check the installation by opening the terminal tab in RStudio (or use whatever terminal you already have open) and entering:

``` zsh
git --version
```

#### Set the git path in RStudio

To get RStudio to use the updated Git, you need to tell RStudio where to find the newly installed Git. First, get the path to the Git executable by typing:

``` zsh
which git
```

![RStudio Terminal window](../assets/git-version.png){.lightbox fig-align="left" width="60%"}

Next, in RStudio, go to *Tools* â†’ *Global Options*. You will get the menu in *(a)*:

::: {#fig-git layout-ncol="2" layout-valign="bottom"}
![Global Options](../assets/git-path.png){#fig-options .lightbox}

![git path](../assets/git-path-browse.png){#fig-path .lightbox}

Setting the Git path in RStudio
:::

1.  Choose *Git/SVN*.
2.  Browse to `git` using the path obtained from the `which git` command. See *(b)*, above.
3.  Click *Apply*.
4.  Click *OK*.

::: callout-note
The `git` executable in `/opt/homebrew/bin/git` is an alias that points to `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/git/2.45.0/bin/git`. When you browse to `/opt/homebrew/bin/git`, it gets resolved to the correct path.
:::

Now RStudio will use the updated Git.

### Windows

Windows users should go to the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) to get the latest Windows build.
