## Git and a GitHub Account

::: callout-tip
We will use `git` within RStudio. On macOS, RStudio with echo the mac terminal. I am using [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as my `zsh` framework, and [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my terminal emulator rather than the macOS default terminal application. I also have the latest `git` version installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

This means that I need to adjust the settings in RStudio to use my `zsh` environment. Go to *Tools* → *Global Options* → *Terminal* and choose `Zsh` from the drop-down menu for the *New terminals open with* option.
