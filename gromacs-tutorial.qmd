An exceptionally good tutorial of an intrinsically disordered protein has been developed by the [Bonvin Lab](https://www.bonvinlab.org/).

The tutorial was developed as part of the [Structural Bioinformatics & Modelling](https://www.bonvinlab.org/education/molmod_online/) course maintained by [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/).
